# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Context

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

We have three main data visualizations on the page: a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs found in an individual, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and a metadata table that displays the individual's demographic information.

All the charts and visualizations will update when a new sample ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
